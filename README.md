# 📊 SQL Exploratory Data Analytics Project
---
## 📌 Overview
This project showcases the use of SQL for performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a structured dataset. The goal is to uncover insights, identify patterns, and prepare the data for further modeling or reporting. It demonstrates proficiency in writing efficient SQL queries to clean, summarize, and visualize data directly within a relational database environment.
---
### 🧠 Objectives
- Clean and preprocess raw data using SQL filtering and transformation techniques
- Explore key metrics using aggregation functions (SUM, AVG, COUNT, MAX, MIN)
- Identify missing values, duplicates, and outliers
- Analyze categorical and numerical distributions
- Segment data by relevant dimensions (e.g., region, product, time)
- Generate insights for business decisions or modeling readiness
---
### 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- SQL Server / PostgreSQL / MySQL (adaptable to any RDBMS)
- SQL: SELECT, JOIN, GROUP BY, CASE, WINDOW FUNCTIONS, CTEs, SUBQUERIES
- Database Client: SSMS, DBeaver, pgAdmin, or any preferred SQL IDE
